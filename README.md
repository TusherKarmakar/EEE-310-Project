In this project, remote patient monitoring devices are used to record a patient's health data and this data on vital signs is then automatically compared to the upper and lower (threshold) values set by a physician. If the threshold value is breached, the RPM system at the healthcare facility triggers a notification that generates a warning message and alerts a physician that there is an abnormal situation. This notification to the doctor is sent through email. Through this project, healthcare providers can track a patient's health through the health data they receive electronically from the patient's health monitoring devices and, based on this data, can perform assessments and provide recommendations.
